# FormAssist
This tool converts short Telugu speech inputs into well-structured Telugu or English formal letters using language models. The solution is designed for ward/gram volunteers, ASHA and Anganwadi workers to quickly generate complaint letters, applications, and field visit reports to reduce writing time and support low-literate users.
